          <p class="iconText">
            Not a fan of the traditional radiator? Underfloor heating and
            cooling is a modern form of central heating that achieves indoor
            climate control.

        <h3>
          What is the time scale of having a bathroom fitted? <span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="answer hidden">
          Once the design and layout has been confirmed by all parties, the average timescale is 15 days. This is on the basis that the bathroom is an ‘average’ sized bathroom and the room is being stripped back to the brick. If the bathroom is smaller, then it could be quicker, providing there are no technical complications due to size. For larger bathrooms, the timescale is likely to be closer to 4 weeks.

        <h3>
          What is included in the price? <span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="answer hidden">
          In the price we include the supply, design and installation of your luxury bathroom. This includes: plumbing, joinery, tiling, plastering and decorating. We pride ourselves on being able to manage the whole process, start to finish. 
        </p>

      <div class="questions ">
        <h3>
          Can I use the bathroom whilst you work on it? <span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="answer hidden">
          We will always reconnect the toilet where possible and your bathroom will be left as clean and tidy  as it can be when we leave. This is useful when you only have one bathroom in the house. However, we can not guarantee you will be able to shower or use the bath until completion.

        <h3>
          Why should I choose you over other companies? <span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="answer hidden">
          We are an experienced team with many skills that we always apply to every project we take on. As a small and local business we always strive to offer a personal and individual service to every one of our customers.

        <h3>
          Do I need any planning permission for my new luxury bathroom? <span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="answer hidden">
          Usually there is no need for planning permission for fitting a new bathroom unless the building is a listed building. There may however be building regulations if you are adding a new bathroom, for example converting a former bedroom into a new bathroom.
        </p>

          What are your payment terms? <span><i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="answer hidden">
We request that 50% of the overall bill is paid upfront and the remaining 50% is paid upon completion of the project, once you are happy with your new bathroom.         </p>
